Install instructions for Tartini (version 1.2.0)

To compile Tartini 1.2.0 from the source:

Step 1.
Make sure the following libraries are installed on your system
- Qt 4.x
- GLU
- Alsa
- fftw3   (configured with the --enable-float option)
- Qwt 5.x
(Fttw and Qwt could be downloaded from http://www.tartini.net but osme links are broken)
Website for FFTW : http://www.fftw.org/download.html
Website for QWT : http://qwt.sourceforge.net/

For Ubuntu users the previous packages can be installed using
apt and the following packet names: libqt4-dev libqwt5-qt4-dev libfftw3-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev

Step 2.
Edit pitch.pro and edit MY_TARTINI_PATH if you want to build from another directory


Step 3.
At the command prompt (from in the directory) type:
qmake pitch.pro       - This will generate a Makefile
make                  - This will compile the executable called tartini.
lrelease pitch.pro    - This will generate the translations for tartini supported languages

Note: To compile on Windows you need to use MinGW (www.mingw.org),
since Qt4 is not supported for Visual Studio under the GPL edition.

Note: qmake comes as part of the Qt4 package
