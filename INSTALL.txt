Install instruction for Tartini (version 1)


Step 1.
Make sure the following libraries are installed on your system
- Qt 3.x
- fftw3   (configured with the --enable-float option)
- Qwt 4.2
(these can be downloaded from http://www.tartini.net)


Step 2.
Edit pitch.pro and put the correct library and include paths for your setup.


Step 3.
Under Linux type (from in the directory):
qmake pitch.pro       - This will generate a Makefile
make                  - This will compile the executable called tartini.

Under MacOSX you can do the same as for Linux or you can run the
gomax script to generate an xcode project.

Under Windows you can do the same as for Linux, but use nmake instead of make,
or you can run the gowindows.bat to generate a Visual Studio 6 project.
